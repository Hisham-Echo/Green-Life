# Green Life

## Project Idea:

### What problem are we talking about ?

carbon diffusion problem .
It can be said that the problems of carbon emission are
represented in their impact on the environment and
public health, as carbon emission leads to an increase in
the earth's temperature and climate change, which leads
to changes in weather, seasons and climatic conditions,
and its impact on terrestrial and marine life, and also
leads to an increase in air pollution. and water, which
affects human and animal health.


### Causes of carbon spread ?

Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by human
activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, forestry,
industries, and agriculture, and it is absorbed by plants,
oceans, soil, rocks, and volcanoes, and both cycles are
interconnected. This leads to an increase in the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which leads to a
significant rise in temperatures, which affects the general
climate in the world.


### Methods for solving carbon diffusion ?

Many methods can be used to reduce the spread of carbon
in the atmosphere, including:
Direct air capture technology, which removes carbon
dioxide from the air and stores it underground.
Convert carbon dioxide to sodium bicarbonate and store it
safely and cheaply in seawater.
Plant trees. A trillion trees can store two-thirds of the
carbon released into the atmosphere since the Industrial
Revolution


### The relationship of the problem of carbon diffusion with sustainable development ?

Carbon diffusion can affect sustainable development in
several ways, as it can lead to climate change and
increased temperatures, affecting agriculture, health and
the environment. It can also lead to air pollution, which
affects human health and the environment. Therefore,
carbon diffusion must be reduced to achieve sustainable
development.
